### Docker Compose `up`

The `docker-compose up` command is a fundamental part of Docker Compose, a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. This command is used to create and start containers defined in a `docker-compose.yml` file.

### Prerequisites

Before using `docker-compose up`, make sure you have Docker Compose installed on your system. You can download it from the official Docker Compose GitHub repository: [Docker Compose Releases](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases).

### Usage

To use the `docker-compose up` command, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the Directory:**

   Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where your `docker-compose.yml` file is located.

2. **Run `docker-compose up`:**

   To build and start the containers defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file, use the following command:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d

### Access the Flask Application:

- By default, your Flask application may be running on a specific port within the container. To access it, you'll need to map the container port to a port on your host machine. 

- If you've configured your docker-compose.yml file correctly, you can access the Flask application in a web browser at http://localhost:{host_port}, where {host_port} is the port on your host machine that you mapped to the Flask application container's port.

**Interacting with Your Flask Application**:

You can interact with your Flask application just as you would with a locally hosted Flask app. Make HTTP requests to the specified endpoint, and you should receive responses from your containerized application.
